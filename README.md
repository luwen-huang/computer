# Computer
We want to build something like the computer in StarTrek which can do complex queries based on natrual language speech.

## Game Plan
#### Step 1
Make a system which can run a comand which is stated as a query
- "What is the length of students?"
#### Step 2
Make a system which can run simple queries that don't need a bunch of joins

## Existing Resources
This is a list of existing attempts to do this which we would do well to use as a jumping off point.

### Packages
- [Natural language to SPARQL Queries](https://github.com/machinalis/quepy)
- Natural language to SQL Queries
	- [Kueri](http://kueri.me)
	- [FriendlyData](https://friendlydata.io)

## Speech to Text
A starting point for speech recognition is [SpeechRecognition](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SpeechRecognition)
for python. I will edit this document to have notes on how well this tool works and other tools I find.

## Natural Language to Query
This should be populated with ideas from [Existing Resources](#existing-resources)

### Test Cases
- "How many students are there" => students.length

## Example Datasets
Our goal was to start with JSON files, so I have started by populated the example-datasets folder with 
JSON files from [JsonStudio](http://jsonstudio.com/resources/).
- companies.json
- enron.json
- stocks.json
- world_bank.json
- zips.json
